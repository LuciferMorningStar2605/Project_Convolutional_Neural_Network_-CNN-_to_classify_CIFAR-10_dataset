# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## üìå Objective  
The objective of this project is to provide **hands-on experience in implementing and applying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, evaluate its performance, and compare the results of different configurations.

## üìÇ Project Overview  
This project explores the design, training, and evaluation of CNN models for **image classification** tasks using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes.  

The project workflow includes:  
- Data preprocessing and normalization  
- Building CNN architectures with varying configurations  
- Training and evaluation of models  
- Performance comparison and visualization  
- Drawing insights from accuracy, loss curves, and classification reports

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Normalization of pixel values to range `[0,1]`  
   - Conversion of class labels to categorical (one-hot encoding)  

2. **Model Development (CNN)**  
   - Multiple CNN architectures were designed using convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.  
   - Different hyperparameter settings (filters, kernel sizes, activation functions, optimizers) were tested.  

3. **Training and Validation**  
   - Models were trained with training data and validated using test data.  
   - Early stopping and dropout layers were applied to reduce overfitting.  

4. **Evaluation & Metrics**  
   - Accuracy and loss curves plotted for analysis  
   - Classification reports and confusion matrix used to assess per-class performance  

5. **Comparison of Configurations**  
   - Results of different CNN configurations were compared  
   - Insights were drawn on model performance, training stability, and generalization

## üìä Results & Analysis
- CNN achieved significant improvement over baseline methods.  
- Certain architectures with **deeper layers + dropout** showed better generalization.  
- Performance visualization helped in identifying overfitting vs. underfitting scenarios.
